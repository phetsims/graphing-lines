TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML5 port)

DESIGN

HIGH
- game doesn't work on iPad, sim never comes up
- performance stinks on iPad
- consolidate equation fontSize and fontWeight in GLConstants
- address lots of TODO items in the code
- update best time in LineGameModel

MEDIUM
- rounded corners on spinners, see Shape.roundRect
- convert LineGameModel (9 properties) to PropertySet
- replace 'GameOverNode' and 'GameSettingsPanel' with vegas components
- game reward, see build-an-atom#62

LOW
- convert translated strings of the form '<htm>foo<br>bar</html>' to 'foo\nbar'
- convert icons to images in IconFactory
- i18n of credits, joist#66

PERFORMANCE
- lousy on iPad
- consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- revisit *EquationNode subtypes to reduce size of constructor and minimize updates (or not... liable to destabilize)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- Spinner
