TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML5 port)

DESIGN

HIGH
- at end of a challenge, plotted point is not always on top of line
- performance stinks on iPad
- consolidate equation fontSize and fontWeight in GLConfig

MEDIUM
- rounded corners on spinners, see Shape.roundRect
- use HTMLText in SlopeEquationNode.createGeneralFormNode when HTMLText bounds is fixed
- horizontal space between text and icons is wrong in sun.CheckBox, problem with scenery.Text bounds?

LOW
- use 'pattern' prefix for all strings that contain {0} placeholders
- convert translated strings of the form '<htm>foo<br>bar</html>' to 'foo\nbar'
- use 'Property' suffix consistently
- convert icons to images in IconFactory
- convert models to PropertySet and axon style
- change 'tab.*' string keys to 'screen.*'
- omit subtype-specific options before passing them to supertype, phet-core#3
- i18n of credits
- ok to use <font> tag in PointSlopeEquationNode.createGeneralFormNode and SlopeEquationNode.createGeneralFormNode?

PERFORMANCE
- lousy on iPad
- consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- revisit *EquationNode subtypes to reduce size of constructor and minimize updates (or not... liable to destabilize)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- Spinner
- ExpandCollapseButton
