TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML port)

DESIGN

HIGH
- SlopeInterceptEquationNode, for labeling standard lines

MEDIUM
- line highlighting isn't working correctly, line doesn't change color, parts of equation change color and stay that way
- pass font properties instead of just size to various UI components (especially equations)
- DecimalFormat
- implement IconFactory
- rounded corners on spinners

LOW
- delete PointSlopeViewTests
- convert models to PropertySet and axon style
- consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- change 'tab.*' string keys to 'screen.*'
- remove '.' from string keys so we don't have to use GLStrings["foo.bar"]
- import all string files from Java sim

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- Spinner
- generalize timer code used in Spinner, borrowed from ArrowButton
