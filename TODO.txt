TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML port)

DESIGN

HIGH
- CheckBox.createTextCheckBox layout isn't working with an icon, scenery 'loop' branch issue?
- implement create* methods in SlopeToolNode and GraphNode, add setEnabled to what's returned
- port common.view package from Java
- port pointslope.view package from Java

MEDIUM
- consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- convert models to PropertySet and axon style
- Slope Tool icon, for control panel
- Graph icons, for control panel

LOW
- change 'tab.*' string keys to 'screen.*'
- remove '.' from string keys so we don't have to use GLStrings["foo.bar"]
- import all string files from Java sim

MIGRATE TO COMMON
