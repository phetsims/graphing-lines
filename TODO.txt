TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML5 port)

PERFORMANCE
- performance stinks on iPad
- EquationNode subtypes: mutate instead of alloc when Line changes?
- EquationNode subtypes do lots of addChild/removeChild, change visibility instead?
- GraphTheLineNode creates complex children whenever the guess changes, line 99
- put graph in its own layer, since it doesn't change (quick test indicates negligible benefits)
- last resort: consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- reduce startup time

USABILITY
- make manipulators have a 'halo' that appears on mouseOver or touchDown, specify halo color since alpha needs to be different depending on color
- get new point tool image from AP

HIGH
- put 'Level N' above icon in level-selection buttons
- fix horizontal alignment of value in NumberPicker
- vegas#7, add option to show 'best time' on vegas.LevelStartButton (display time below button, pickable:false)
- address TODO items in the code
- make sure that level-selection button stars reflect best score, not most recent score

MEDIUM
- game reward, see build-an-atom#62

LOW

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- DimensionalArrowNode
