TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML5 port)

PERFORMANCE
- replace add/removeChild with visible in equations
- 11% in setTipAndTail (in ArrowNode or DimensionalArrowNode? use MutableArrowNode?)
- GraphTheLineNode creates complex children whenever the guess changes, line 99
- put graph in its own layer, since it doesn't change (quick test indicates negligible benefits)

USABILITY

HIGH
- improve responsiveness of interactive line manipulators
- position equation on line based on visibleBounds, current approach of putting invisible nodes at (0,0) may have i18n problems
- reduce startup time
- get new point tool image from AP, graphing-lines#2

MEDIUM
- add game reward, see vegas#4
- add option to show 'best time' on vegas.LevelStartButton, vegas#7
- address TODO items in the code

LOW

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- DimensionalArrowNode
