TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML5 port)

PERFORMANCE
- EquationNode subtypes: mutate instead of alloc when Line changes?
- EquationNode subtypes do lots of addChild/removeChild, change visibility instead?
- GraphTheLineNode creates complex children whenever the guess changes, line 99
- put graph in its own layer, since it doesn't change (quick test indicates negligible benefits)

USABILITY

MEDIUM
