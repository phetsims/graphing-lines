TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML5 port)

PERFORMANCE
- performance stinks on iPad
- put graph in its own layer, since it doesn't change (move Graph.lines to model, don't extend GraphNode, ...?)
- EquationNode: mutate instead of alloc when Line changes?
- EquationNode subtypes do lots of addChild/removeChild, change visibility instead?
- last resort: consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection

USABILITY
- make manipulators bigger, or make them smaller with a 'halo'
- add a tab on right side of point tool, so you can see values while moving on tablet

HIGH
- remove Graph.lines, move to model, so that GraphNode can be independent and drawn in its own layer
- vegas#7, add option to show 'best time' on vegas.LevelStartButton
- address TODO items in the code

MEDIUM
- game reward, see build-an-atom#62

LOW

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- DimensionalArrowNode
