TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML5 port)

PERFORMANCE
- performance stinks on iPad
- put graph in its own layer, since it doesn't change
- consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- changing a line results in allocation of: Line, LineNode, EquationNode
- EquationNode subtypes do lots of addChild/removeChild
- SlopeToolNode does removeAllChildren when its line changes

USABILITY
- make manipulators bigger, or make them smaller with a 'halo'
- add a tab on right side of point tool, so you can see values while moving on tablet
- large touchArea for spinners
- dead zone between button and arrow in spinners, set mouseArea?

HIGH
- disable slope-tool icon when 'slope' check box is disabled
- add option to show 'best time' on vegas.LevelStartButton
- address TODO items in the code

MEDIUM
- game reward, see build-an-atom#62

LOW
