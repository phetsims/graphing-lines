TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML5 port)

DESIGN

HIGH
- performance stinks on iPad
- consolidate equation fontSize and fontWeight in GLConstants
- address lots of TODO items in the code

MEDIUM
- replace 'GameOverNode' and 'GameSettingsPanel' with vegas components
- game reward, see build-an-atom#62

LOW
- convert translated strings of the form '<htm>foo<br>bar</html>' to 'foo\nbar'
- convert icons to images in IconFactory

PERFORMANCE
- lousy on iPad
- put graph in its own layer, since it doesn't change
- consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- revisit *EquationNode subtypes to reduce size of constructor and minimize updates (or not... liable to destabilize)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- Spinner
