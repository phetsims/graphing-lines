TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML port)

DESIGN

HIGH
- debug interactive form of SlopeEquationNode
- implement non-interactive form of SlopeEquationNode
- call separate factory functions from SlopeEquationNode constructor, depending on whether equation is interactive
- SlopeInterceptEquationNode constructor

MEDIUM
- better placeholder icons for screens
- line highlighting isn't working correctly, line doesn't change color, parts of equation change color and stay that way
- implement IconFactory
- rounded corners on spinners
- Game
- use HTMLText in SlopeEquationNode.createGeneralFormNode when HTMLText bounds is fixed
- horizontal space between text and icons is wrong in check boxes, problem with scenery.Text bounds?
- flatten the nested options parameter for NumberBackgroundNode
- replace NumberBackgroundNode(value) with more general BackgroundNode(childNode), or use sun.Panel?

LOW
- DecimalFormat instead of decimalPlaces
- pass font properties instead of just size to various UI components (especially equations)
- delete PointSlopeViewTests
- convert models to PropertySet and axon style
- consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- change 'tab.*' string keys to 'screen.*'
- remove '.' from string keys so we don't have to use GLStrings["foo.bar"]
- import all string files from Java sim

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- Spinner
- generalize timer code used in Spinner, borrowed from ArrowButton
- ExpandCollapseButton
