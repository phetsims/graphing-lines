TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML5 port)

DESIGN

HIGH
- make manipulators bigger, or make them smaller with a 'halo'
- add a tab on right side of point tool, so you can see values while moving on tablet
- expand touchArea for "Hide lines" check box
- large touchArea for spinners
- dead zone between button and arrow in spinners, set mouseArea?
- increase x-margins for 'Save Lines' and 'Erase Lines' buttons (increase default x-margin in sun?)
- increase font size in interactive equations for all screens
- add option to show 'best time' on vegas.LevelStartButton
- performance stinks on iPad
- consolidate equation fontSize and fontWeight in GLConstants
- address lots of TODO items in the code

MEDIUM
- add bestScores {Array<Property{Number}>} to LineGameModel, for populating stars in LevelStartButtons
- replace 'GameSettingsPanel' with vegas components (see BAA.StartGameLevelNode)
- game reward, see build-an-atom#62

LOW
- convert translated strings of the form '<htm>foo<br>bar</html>' to 'foo\nbar'
- convert icons to images in IconFactory

PERFORMANCE
- lousy on iPad
- put graph in its own layer, since it doesn't change
- consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- revisit *EquationNode subtypes to reduce size of constructor and minimize updates (or not... liable to destabilize)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- Spinner
