TODO list for graphing-lines (HTML port)

DESIGN

HIGH
- standard and saved lines are not removed from the graph
- SlopeInterceptEquationNode
- add press-&-hold feature to Spinner

MEDIUM
- pass font properties instead of just size to various UI components (especially equations)
- DecimalFormat
- implement IconFactory
- rounded corners on spinners

LOW
- convert models to PropertySet and axon style
- consider making Line mutable, to reduce affects of garbage collection
- change 'tab.*' string keys to 'screen.*'
- remove '.' from string keys so we don't have to use GLStrings["foo.bar"]
- import all string files from Java sim

MIGRATE TO COMMON
